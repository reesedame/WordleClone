- **WordleClone:** Can't get enough of Wordle? Neither can I, so I created a clone that allows you to play as much as you want! For the uninitiated, Wordle is a puzzle game where you get six chances to guess a five-letter word.
- **Technologies Used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Getting Started:** To play the game, click [here](https://reesedame.github.io/WordleClone/).
  - After entering a guess you will notice the background color of the letters changes.
    - If the color is gray, the letter is not in the wordle.
    - If the color is yellow, the letter is in the wordle but it's in the wrong position.
    - If the color is green, the letter is in the wordle and is in the correct position.
  - Try to identify the wordle in as few guesses as possible. But don't worry, you can always play again!
  - _Note: if you would like to play with a dark color theme, click on the moon icon in the upper right-hand corner._
- **Next Steps:**
  - Allow player to enter only real words as their guesses (ie "QQQQQ" could not be entered).
  - Allow player to choose the length of the wordle.
  - Allow the player to choose a difficulty; this could mean that the player has fewer guesses or an uncommon word as the wordle.
  - Allow player to create different color themes.
